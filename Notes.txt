*Firepoint flip issue
	*idea:Instead of using the sr.flip to flip my character, rotate the player by 180 degrees on the y-axis and it will flip the .
	*Current State: WORKS

*Hover Mechanics
	*Original Idea:When the player !grounded && holds down the space, set the y velocity = 0.
	*Issue: Player stills "falls" but at a much slower paste. Might be due to the gravity feature in rigidbody2d.
	* Current State: Not Fixed

*Gun mechanics
	*Shotgun:
		*Idea:From the fire point, shoot 3 bullets from 3 seperate angles. Shoots once per click
		*Current State: WORKS 
		*Issue: had to put paratheses around the math part

	*Assualt rifle:
		*Idea:From the fire point, shoot bullets with a 500 milisecond pause time between each bullet. Fires until the trigger is release or runs out of ammo. Animation doesnt work
		*Current State: Not tested

	*Sniper/BFG:
		*Idea: From the fire point, fires one big bullet. Shoots once per click. May have cool down between shots. Will keep going until it has hit designated number of enemies, hits a wall, or timer runs out. Animation doesnt work
		*Current State: Not Finished

*Roll Dodge
	*Idea:
		When the player presses cntrl while xMovement != 0 and grounded, player plays roll animations and has bullet immunity. 
	*Issue: Not sure how to do it... Cant test as of now...
	*Current State: Not fully implemented

*Taking Damage
	*Issue: in bullet script, grab the controller of either the enemy or player, depending who's hit, and call a take damage function
	*Current state: Working

*Radio buttons - Enumerations

*User Interface
	* Idea: Health bar (top left), lives: 3 (3 player heads right of the health bar), Ammo: have a bullet preview with ammo status (magazine/reserve) (Bottom right). Have a fuel bar under the health bar (only appears when hovering). Tiny health bars that hover above the enemies (only appears after they been hit by a bullet).

*Levels:
	*Lvl01: have text on the screen that describes movement controls. Player moves onto a dummy AI to learn shooting. Player only has single fire on this level.
	*Lvl02: Player goes through an relatively easy level to test out their skills. Just a simple platformer with some shooting.
	*lvl03: A CQC level where a shotgun, which the player will find early on in the level, will be most effective.
