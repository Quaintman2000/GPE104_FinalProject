*Firepoint flip issue
	*idea:
		add or subtract 0.38 (distance from player) from player's current x position based on direction moving.
	*Current State: WORKS but might be more efficient way...

*Hover Mechanics
	*Original Idea:When the player !grounded && holds down the space, set the y velocity = 0.
	*Issue: Player stills "falls" but at a much slower paste. Might be due to the gravity feature in rigidbody2d.
	* Current State: Not Fixed

*Gun mechanics
	*Shotgun:
		*Idea:From the fire point, shoot 3 bullets from 3 seperate angles. Shoots once per click
		*Current State: WORKS!

	*Assualt rifle:
		*Idea:From the fire point, shoot bullets with a 500 milisecond pause time between each bullet. Fires until the trigger is release or runs out of ammo.
		*Current State: Not tested

	*Sniper/BFG:
		*Idea: From the fire point, fires one big bullet. Shoots once per click. May have cool down between shots. Will keep going until it has hit designated number of enemies, hits a wall, or timer runs out
		*Current State: Not Finished

*Roll Dodge
	*Idea:
		When the player presses cntrl while xMovement != 0 and grounded, player plays roll animations and has bullet immunity. 
	*Issue: Not sure how to do it... Cant test as of now...
	*Current State: Not fully implemented
